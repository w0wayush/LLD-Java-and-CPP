# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## What is SRP?

1. A class should have one, and only one reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.
2. A class should only be responsible for one thing.
3. There's a place for everything and everything in its place.
4. Find one reason to change and take everything else out of the class.
5. **Importance:** Following `SRP` makes your code more modular, easier to understand, maintain, and extend. It helps in isolating functionalities, making debugging and testing more straightforward.

## In One Statement

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This promotes modularization and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Key Idea:

A class should do only one thing, and it should do it well.

## Real-Time Examples:

1. Think of a chef who only focuses on cooking, not managing the restaurant or delivering food.

2. In auth system, user only focuses on login, not sending email or verify email

3. In a household setting, the book container exclusively stores books, the food bucket is designated for food items only, and the tool box is specifically reserved for tools, ensuring each container serves its intended purpose without mixing items.

## How can Single Responsibility Principle be applied?

### Practical Coding Examples in Java #1

```java
// Violet SRP: Chef class with additional responsibilities
class Chef {
    public void cook(String dish) {
        System.out.println("Chef is cooking " + dish);
        // Cooking logic goes here
    }

    public void manageRestaurant() {
        System.out.println("Chef is managing the restaurant");
        // Management logic goes here
    }

    public void deliverFood() {
        System.out.println("Chef is delivering food");
        // Delivery logic goes here
    }
}


// Not Violet SRP: Chef class with a single responsibility of cooking
class Chef {
    public void cook(String dish) {
        System.out.println("Chef is cooking " + dish);
        // Cooking logic goes here
    }
}
```

### Practical Coding Examples in Java #2

```java
// Violet SRP: User class with additional responsibilities
class User {
    public void login() {
        // logic for user login
    }

    public void sendEmail() {
        // logic for sending email
    }

    public void verifyEmail() {
        // logic for verifying email
    }
}

// Not Violet SRP: User class with a single responsibility of login
class User {
    public void login() {
        // logic for user login
    }
}
```

### Practical Coding Examples in Java #3

```java
// Violet SRP: BookContainer class with additional responsibilities
class BookContainer {
    public void manageBooks() {
        // logic for managing books
    }
    public void manageFood() {
        // logic for managing food
    }
    public void manageTools() {
        // logic for managing tools
    }
}

// Not Violet SRP: All classes with a single responsibility
class BookContainer {
    public void manageBooks() {
        // logic for managing books
    }
}
class FoodBucket {
    public void manageFood() {
        // logic for managing food
    }
}
class ToolBox {
    public void manageTools() {
        // logic for managing tools
    }
}
```
